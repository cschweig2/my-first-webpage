  <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>

  <div>
    <p>Here are a few places in the world that I love to go to!</p>
    <h4>Hawaii</h4>
      <img src="img/hawaii.jpg" alt="Hawaii">
      <p>Hawaii may seem like a cliche, but it <em>truly</em> is a beautiful place. I enjoy visiting the Big Island most, because of its diverse ecosystems and landscapes.</p>
    <h4>Alaska</h4>
      <p>Ah... The Final Frontier. Alaska is a majestic, serene place with gorgeous mountains, trees, lakes, and wildlife. While I have only been to Juneau, I was still taken back by the vast beauty. My husband worked and lived in Alaska for many summers, and our wedding rings are made of gold mined from the Yukon Territory (bordering Alaska) where the first goldrush took place.</p>
    <h4>India</h4>
      <p>I first visited India in 2017 and spent 3 weeks travelling around the major northern cities such as New Delhi, Jaipur, Palampur, and Dharamsala. While I haven't been to southern India, I must say that the cities at the base of the Himalayas are the most beautiful I have ever seen.</p>
    <h4>New Jersey</h4>
      <p>I have to include New Jersey on this list being that it is my home state. Most people don't know this, but New Jersey has beautiful forests, rivers, farmlands, mountains, and beaches. We also have arguably the best pizza in the country, something that is hard to come by west of the state.</p>
